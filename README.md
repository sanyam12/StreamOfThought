<b> # **Project Goal:** </b>

The main goal of our project was to make an app for every person who wants to write something. He need not to be a writer. Poems, Sonnets,
Short Stories, Blogs, Shayari, anything are very vital means to express oneself, to provide information, to persuade or to create a literary 
work. Our project 'stream of thoughts' holds the purpose of persuading everyone to come on this platform and let your thoughts reach out the
world. One can also showcase his talent of writing on this app. Sometimes the lines or stories we read take us to a fantasy world which will
serve as an escape from reality (which we think everyone gonna need sooner or later). Awaring the human community about the recent global 
particulars is also one of our projects's objective.

<b> # **Project Description** </b>

Barefoot_LIfe allows a soul to touch the crowd with his words and to increase positive emotions. The app with very simple and interactive interface
helps the users to register themselves without providing any detailed instruction pages. The app designed with basic android concepts provides you 
with below cool functionalities.

Drop-a-line:  A basic fragment which will allow you to see everyone's post. A dialogue box with title and user name written will be displayed
	            and one can simply open it, like it, share it and even can save to his collection. The number of likes u get will motivate you to
	            write more.
		     
Drafts:       A feature made for your compostions. Sometimes we can not compose our post in a single day. Thoughts take time to compile. So this feature
              will serve as a notepad which will save everything you write as a draft. You can edit it, delete it, post it anytime you want.
	      
Memes:        Mark Twain says,"Make memes, Not wars". The coolest feature of this app is the memes fragment. It will help you increase your confidence 
              of survival during this never ending pandemic. You can have moments of relaxation everyday. And the main part, you can even share them with your
              family and friends.
	      
Profile Page: A fragment containing your display name and email id. You can write you bio and uplaod your profile picture also. Besides profile
	       picture, your followers will be displayed. Plus an option to hide your name is also provided.
