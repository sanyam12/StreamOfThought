# Barefoot_LIfe, the fewer burdens and restrictions you have in life, the freer you are
<b> **Project Goal:** </b>

The main goal of our project was to make an app for every person who wants to write something. He need not to be a writer. Poems, Sonnets,
Short Stories, Blogs, Shayari, anything are very vital means to express oneself, to provide information, to persuade or to create a literary 
work. Our project 'stream of thoughts' holds the purpose of persuading everyone to come on this platform and let your thoughts reach out the
world. One can also showcase his talent of writing on this app. Sometimes the lines or stories we read take us to a fantasy world which will
serve as an escape from reality (which we think everyone gonna need sooner or later). Awaring the human community about the recent global 
particulars is also one of our projects's objective.

<b> **Project Description:** </b>

Barefoot_LIfe allows a soul to touch the crowd with his words and to increase positive emotions. The app with very simple and interactive interface
helps the users to register themselves without providing any detailed instruction pages. The app designed with basic android concepts provides you 
with below cool functionalities.

Drop-a-line:  A basic fragment which will allow you to see everyone's post. A dialogue box with title and user name written will be displayed
	      and one can simply open it, like it, and share it. The number of likes u get will motivate you to write more.
	      
Memes:        Mark Twain says,"Make memes, Not wars". The coolest feature of this app is the memes fragment. It will help you increase your confidence 
              of survival during this never ending pandemic. You can have moments of relaxation everyday. And the main part, you can even share them with your
              family and friends.
	      
Profile Page: A fragment containing your display name and email id. You can also uplaod your profile picture.

<b> **Future Scope:** </b>

We aim to add a number of more features like search box where you can find other users and follow them. The followers of a user will be shown in side of profile pic.
We also want to add a feature where a peron can have his name confidential. We also seek to add recycler view in memes section so that one can view once viewed memes also.
We will also try to add a feature of save to collection which will save your memes and posts on your profile page. We also seek to have a draft fragment where one can 
compose his post in any number of days (it will only be visible to the user), can edit it any number of times until ready to post. A comment box will also be provided below every post so that one can know the world's views on his lines. A bio in profile page will also be added to help user write about himself.
